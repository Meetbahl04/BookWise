# BookWise
The Book Recommendation System uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and cosine similarity to suggest books based on user preferences. It processes data with Pandas and NumPy, optimizes memory using sparse matrices, and evaluates accuracy with precision and recall. Built with Python and scikit-learn.
